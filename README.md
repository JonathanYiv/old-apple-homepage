# Old Apple Homepage Project

This purpose of this project was to practice using backgrounds and gradients in HTML/CSS by implementing this old [Apple Homepage](http://web.archive.org/web/20140301004610/http://www.apple.com/).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/html5-and-css3/lessons/building-with-backgrounds-and-gradients).
